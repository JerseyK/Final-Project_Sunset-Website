# 1. open this code
# 2. open terminal
# 3. change directory (cd) to this file
# 4. command line: conda activate streamlit-env
# 5.command line streamlit run Welcome.py
# 6. continue code

# if adding new packages to the .py file you MUST also add them to the requirements.txt file
# After doing so update the environment (MUST BE IN THE SAME FOLDER as the prior enviorment)
# Command Line: conda env update --name streamlit-env --file environment.yml --prune

#Note: 
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     conda activate streamlit-env
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     conda deactivate

# Impact of COVID-19 on Supply Chain from a Financial Perspective
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy and disrupted supply chains across various industries. As a result, we conducted an analysis of the financial factors affecting several companies. We focused on companies that are in the S&P 500 as of 2022 and used data from financial reports in 2019 and 2022 to gain insights into how the pandemic has affected their financial performance.

#### Initial Hypotheses:
1. The amount of technology based companies would increase in 2022. 
2. The amount of contracts involving healthcare/pharmaceutical companies would also increase. 


## Industry Analysis:
The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) comprises 11 sectors that provide a comprehensive framework for organizing companies based on their primary business activities. However, after cleaning our data to compare the changes between 2019 and 2022, we found that only 8 sectors remained: **Materials**, **Industrials**, **Consumer Discretionary**, **Consumer Staples**, **Health Care**, **Financials**, **Information Technology**, and **Communication Services**. These sectors will be the focus of our analysis to gain insights into the changing trends and performance of companies within these industries.

### Below is a breakdown comparing 2019 and 2022 industry sales (`salecs`).
